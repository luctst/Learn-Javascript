>*Let's see what is AJAX and API*

## AJAX
AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript And Xml it allow us to communicate asynchronously with remote servers by using the famous methods POST or GET, with this the servers can send data to your application without reloading your all page.

Today AJAX is really used in the web-development world because it can make your app really fast because of the asynchronous code, you can reload only the parts who received data and not the entire page this is really great for the user.

In comparison language like PHP reload your page entirely when she's send or received data.

## API
API stands for Application Programming Interface it allow your application to easily communicate with other applications, for example you can received and use data from an other application inside your own application like the weather, google maps, youtube video embed etc..

You can create your own API for data coming from your server so the other application can use it, and like i said above you can use third-part API which is API from an other application.
