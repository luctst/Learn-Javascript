> *The data types are kinds of data that we can use to create program, javascript has two data types the first one is primitive and the second one is object.*

## The primitive data types
Javascript has 6 kinds of primitive data types:
- **Number:** floating, decimals and integers, *Javascript always write numbers in decimals (5.0 for example).*
- **String:** Sequence of character, used for text.
- **Boolean:** Can take two values `true` or `false`.
- **Undefined:** Assigned to variable with no value.
- **Null:** Display when you call something who don't exist.

### Examples
```js
let decimal = 5.0;
let number = 5;

let nom = 'lucas';

let booleanTrue = true;
let booleanFalse = false;

let undefined;
```
1. Numbers floating should be written with a `.` and not a `,`.
2. The string data types should be surrounded of '' or "" .
3. Use `true` or `false` to declare boolean.
4. In the last variable we declare a variable with no value if we try to call her we will have `undefined` as result.

> **Note:** Javascript is dynamic typing which means that it automatically recognize which kind of data you're using, instead of language like C or you have to declare data types. 

## The object data types
In computer an object is a value store in the memory of the computer who can be access by an id.

## Current errors
This is a list of the main errors that you can meet when you use data types:
> **Note:** I'm not a wizard there is maybe some issue that you notice above so fell free to open an issue in the [github repo](https://github.com/luctst/learn-javascript) if you find a new error not mentioned above.
